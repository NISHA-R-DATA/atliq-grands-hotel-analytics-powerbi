## üìò Project Overview
**AtliQ Grands**, a leading chain of luxury and business hotels in India, faced significant challenges, including a decline in **market share** and **revenue**. Increased competition, a lack of **data-backed decision-making**, and the absence of an **internal analytics team** led to the underutilization of historical data, resulting in missed strategic opportunities.

To address these challenges, an interactive and comprehensive **Power BI dashboard** was developed, transforming raw booking data into **actionable insights**. These insights aimed to **optimize revenue**, enhance **pricing strategies**, and improve overall **business performance** in a highly competitive market.


*The screenshots provided below highlight the Power BI dashboards created for AtliQ Grands, enabling data-driven insights for improved business performance.*

### Tools and Technologies Used:

| Tool/Technology | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| **Excel** | Initial data exploration, validation, and pre-analysis |

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach
The project was delivered through a **four-phase analytics lifecycle**:

### 1. Data Acquisition & Cleaning
- Imported and examined fact and dimension tables
- Verified data quality using Power BI‚Äôs **Column Quality** tool‚Äîconfirmed **absence of nulls**
- Standardized **data types** across numeric, categorical, and date fields
- Corrected **header alignment issues** in `Dim_Rooms` for structural consistency
- Enriched the `Dim_Date` table with two calculated columns:
  - **Week number** for temporal trend analysis  
  - **Day type (Weekday/Weekend)** for behavioral segmentation  

### 2. Data Modeling
- Implemented a **Star Schema** to optimize performance and enable **drill-down analysis**
- Created **one-to-many relationships** between fact and dimension tables
- Ensured proper **relationship cardinality** and **filter directions** for intuitive reporting

### 3. DAX Calculations
Developed key performance metrics:

- **Revenue KPIs**: Total Revenue, ADR, RevPAR  
- **Booking KPIs**: Total Bookings, DURN, DBRN, DSRN  
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Occupancy Rate, Realization %, Cancellation Rate  

### 4. Dashboard Development
Two interactive **Power BI dashboards** were created to offer comprehensive insights:
